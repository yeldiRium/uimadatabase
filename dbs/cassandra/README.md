Cassandra
=========

The credentials for the Cassandra server are set to default cassandra:cassandra.
I'm not sure how they can be changed on docker creation. Probably some script has
to be provided that executes a few Cassandra queries.

See [here](http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-admin/datastax_enterprise/security/secRBAC.html) somewhere.
