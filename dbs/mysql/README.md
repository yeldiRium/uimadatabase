MySQL
=====

The default credentials are root:root (as set in docker-compose via environment variable).
These can be changed via environment variables `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` on docker initialization.

MySQL needs a database name to function. Ours is called `uimadatabase` for obvious reasons.
