uimadatabase
============

This project evaluates a number of different DBMSs in the context of apache UIMA NLP.
The DBMSs are:
- Arango DB
- BaseX
- Cassandra
- Mongo DB
- MySQL
- Neo4J

Still undecided:
- Microsoft Cosmos DB

The DBMSs are spun up in separate docker containers (if necessary and not externally hosted)
for ease of access.
